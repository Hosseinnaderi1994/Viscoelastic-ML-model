# PINN viscoelastic model
## Description
These files contain codes of the ML viscoelastic model for the prediction of the behavior of various types of Polymers in uniaxial tensile tests.

## Usage
Please save the files. Open the ML model in the MATLAB software. All data and codes for a particular type of polymer are available in a folder. One can run the Main.m file for solving a constrained ML model 
and getting the related results in our published article.

## Citation
