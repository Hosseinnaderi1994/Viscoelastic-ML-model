# PINN viscoelastic model
## Description
These files contains codes of the ML viscoelastic model for prediction of the behavior of various types of Polymers in unaxial test.

## Usage
Please save the files. Open the ML model in the Matlab software. All data and codes for a particular type of polymers are avaiable in a folder. One can run the Main.m file for solving a constrained ML model 
and getting the related results in our published article.
